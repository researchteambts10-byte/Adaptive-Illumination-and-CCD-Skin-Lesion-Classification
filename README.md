# Adaptive-Illumination-and-CCD-Skin-Lesion-Classification
This repository presents the Adaptive Illumination Normalization and Color-Contrast-Depth Segmentation Deep CNN (ALN-C2D-DCNN) model — a robust deep learning framework for automated skin lesion classification.
The model integrates adaptive illumination normalization (ALN) and C2D segmentation to enhance image contrast and extract significant lesion features based on color, contrast, and depth.
Using a custom CNN architecture, the framework achieves up to 99% classification accuracy on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing deep learning methods.
