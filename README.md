# Adaptive-Illumination-and-CCD-Skin-Lesion-Classification
This repository presents the Adaptive Illumination Normalization and Color-Contrast-Depth Segmentation Deep CNN (ALN-C2D-DCNN) model — a robust deep learning framework for automated skin lesion classification. Integrating ALN and C2D segmentation, it enhances image contrast and achieves up to 99% accuracy, surpassing existing methods.
